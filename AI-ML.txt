Machine learning enables intelligent decision-making from data, and my project applies key ML techniques with a focus on Random Forest.

Classification - is a supervised learning technique used to predict category label (Email Spam Detection)

Eg:
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Neural Network

Clustering - is a unsupervised learning approach that groups data into clusters (Document or text clustering)
Eg:
1.K-means
2. Hierarchical clustering
3. Gaussian Mixture Models

Optimization - used in Training models to find the best parameters

------------The Tools I have used is------------------------------------------

Scikit-learn (Random Forest) – A library in Python for machine learning. It provides tools to build models like Random Forest

OpenCV (Image Processing) - A powerful library for processing images and videos. It helps in tasks like detecting objects,

NumPy helps with handling numerical data efficiently (e.g., working with matrices,

Pandas is great for managing large datasets, making it easy to analyze,

Matplotlib – A library for creating graphs and plots. It helps visualize data, making it easier to understand

----------------------------------Random Forest Algorithm in My Project-------------------------------------------

The Random Forest algorithm plays a key role in accurately detecting fire in forest images. It is an fusion learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better predictions.

Random Forest is trained on extracted features like color histograms, texture analysis (GLCM), and edge detection.

Each tree in the forest learns different patterns from the dataset, improving accuracy in fire detection.

Classification - Fire or No Fire:

Given a new forest image, the algorithm analyzes extracted features.

Each decision tree makes its own classification (fire or no fire).

The final prediction is determined through majority voting, ensuring a more reliable decision.

Generating Alerts & Reports:

If "Fire Detected", the system triggers an alert and generates a safety report with:

Immediate precautions

Emergency contact details

Evacuation tips

Fire prevention guidelines

If "No Fire Detected", the system confirms safe forest conditions.

Why Random Forest?
Handles complex data and works well with image features.

Reduces errors by using multiple trees instead of a single decision tree.

Reliable predictions, even with noisy or varied image data.
 

------ Description -------------------------------------------

As i said earlier I have used Random Forest to classify forest images as either "Fire Detected" or "No Fire Detected" based on extracted features. 

The dataset consists of labeled images, which are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and extracting key visual features like color histograms, texture (GLCM), and edge detection using OpenCV. 

These features are then converted into numerical vectors, forming the input for the Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on this processed dataset using Scikit-learn, where multiple decision trees analyze different parts of the data and make individual predictions. 

The final classification is determined using majority voting, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The trained model can process new forest images, predict fire presence, and generate alerts for emergency response. 

To enhance accuracy, I applied data normalization and used StandardScaler, ensuring consistent feature scaling. The model performance was validated using train-test split, and accuracy was measured using metrics like accuracy_score. This system allows automated fire detection, aiding quick response and fire prevention in forest environments.
