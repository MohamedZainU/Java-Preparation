OOPS

1. public is accessible in every package
2. private is accessible within same class
3. protected properties is accessible within same package and sub class of different package
3. default only accessible within same package 

Abstract class can contains both implemented and unimplemented (abstract) methods.

Abstraction acts as a blueprint, providing a general structure while allowing developers to implement details as needed.

So method with no implementation only seen by user but internally it gets extended by diff class and privides the implementation for that
