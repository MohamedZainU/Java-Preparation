Multithreading

Thread and Runnable helps in Multi Threading in Java

Thread is class which implements Runnable interface

A class which is going to be a thread it should extend thread ir implement Runnable or we can use anonymous class to implement this as well since Runnable is a functional interface

when we use thread the calling should be start() and the method in class should be named as run() this is how it works
