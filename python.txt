type() fn which helps in assigning respective datatypes without mentioning them

follow only 1 intendation below for loop print stmt

mylist[0:3] gives 3 elements from 0 1 2

collection of decision trees that groups together to make predictions

multiple decision trees uses sample data each tree is trained on different subset of data algorithm randomly selects subset of data rather than using all available data 

group of friends for advice on where to go for vacation but based on the inputs they gave you take the final decision

advantages
provides very accurate predictions
cab handle missing data without compromising accuracy

disadvantages
computationally expensive especially with large number of trees
harder to interpret compared to decision trees
